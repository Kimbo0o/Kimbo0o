👋 Hi, I’m Kim Daniel.

I am a Frontend Developer from Paderborn, Germany.

In my Day Job I mainly do Web App Development using Vue.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and GaphQL.
In my free time I like to tinker with new technologies and web frameworks.

🌱 I’m currently interested in [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) and the [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
